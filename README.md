Intro
=========

This web application have simple store markers on map. Upon clicking a particular store marker
we can see the details and the ability to chat.This is 
done by sending the response of the user to watson api which analyses the database of that specific store.
Since we are not accessing the database as a whole it will be faster when we are searching in case of 
that specific store.

Usage

```
export FLASK_APP=main.py
flask run
```
